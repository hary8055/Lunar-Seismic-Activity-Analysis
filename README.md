# Lunar-Seismic-Activity-Analysis
This project analyzes seismic activity data collected by the Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) payload onboard the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The aim is to process, explore, and extract meaningful features from the ILSA dataset, which includes correlated and uncorrelated events recorded during the mission.

**Overview**
The Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) is a payload onboard the Chandrayaan-3 lander designed to detect and record seismic signals on the Moon. The data comprises:

Correlated Events: Signals from known activities like rover mobility, payload operation, and drilling.
Uncorrelated Events: Signals from unknown or natural seismic activities.
This project:

1. Processes the ILSA dataset.
2. Extracts features for seismic event identification.
3. Combines and analyzes these features for scientific insights.

**Technical Terms**
1. ILSA: Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity.
2. Correlated Events: Signals with known origins (e.g., rover mobility, payload operations).
3. Uncorrelated Events: Signals from unknown sources, potentially natural seismic activity.
4. PSD (Power Spectral Density): Indicates the power distribution of a signal in the frequency domain.
